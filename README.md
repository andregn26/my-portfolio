Tailwind CSS was selected for styling, enabling a responsive and visually appealing design, with the utility-first approach streamlining the development process. For the backend and database, Sanity was employed, empowering the team to manage content effortlessly and efficiently. Overall, this combination of React, NextJs, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity provided the foundation for a modern, responsive, and user-friendly website for SoulDance, catering to their unique needs and delighting visitors with a seamless dance experience.
