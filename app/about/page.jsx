							Biography
						</h2>
						<p className="font-medium">
							Hi, I'm Andr√©, a web developer and curious self-taught UI/UX designer
							motivated by creating beautiful, functional and user-centric digital
							experiences. Being passionate about art, I am very influenced by the
							rules of composition, color and contrast that I try to bring to my
							projects.
						</p>
						<p className="font-medium mt-2">
							The two years I worked in Marketing helped me combine the visual
							component with strategic thinking capable of understanding the
							communication needs of brands.
						</p>
						<p className="font-medium mt-2">
							I look at web development as a toolbox that allows me to bring all my
							passions and interests together and create something meaningful for
							clients and the community.
